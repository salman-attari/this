    <p>Molly had been staring out of her window for about an hour now. On her desk, lying between the copies of Nature, New Scientist, and all the other <br> scientific journals her work had appeared in, was a well thumbed copy of On The Road. It had been Molly's favourite book since college, and the longer she <br> spent in these four walls the more she felt she needed to be free. <br>
 
 <br>
 
 
     She had spent the last ten years in this room, sitting under a poster with an Oscar Wilde quote proclaiming that Work is the refuge of people who have <br> nothing better to do. Although many considered her pioneering work, unraveling the secrets of the llama DNA, to be an outstanding achievement, Molly <br> did think she had something better to do.</p>
